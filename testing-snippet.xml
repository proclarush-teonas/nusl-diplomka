     <dc:description>This thesis focuses on cooperation between community representatives and local companies. Its aim was - based on questionnaires and on interview with the mayor - to evaluate whether the community representatives cooperate with local entrepreneurs and, if so, how are the community and the private entities engaged and what effects are being achieved. Afterwards, individual analyzes were evaluated; the negatives were identified and corrections of particular situations has been suggested. The development is the general objective of public administration as well as of business sphere. The entrepreneurs aim to develop individual businesses and to achieve their prosperity or to develop the sector in which their enterprise is located. In terms of public sphere, the aim is to create favourable conditions for life of the community inhabitants and for economic development. The entrepreneurs are thus the implementers of economic development, and in terms of small municipalities, the implementers are unambiguously represented by the small and medium entrepreneurs. For both spheres, of the key importance is their cooperation resulting in impacts of their activities. Public administration with its legislative activities is involved in creating a formal framework for business operating and it may - by means of direct administrative and regulatory interventions - form a specific environment for business development. The respondents' answers showed that the cooperation in the community ran on minimized level based on coordination, on information exchange and on implementation of unexacting sub-activities. In most of these cases, unfortunately there is no dynamic and effective cooperation utilizing synergies (effect of joint action). The specific results of applying the principle of cooperation in practice show in particular the necessity of change of the way of communication between business and community representatives; for the effective communication provides more space for involvement of both parties in decision-making processes and thereby it contributes to better effects of cooperation.</dc:description>
